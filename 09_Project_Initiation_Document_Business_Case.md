## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
The **Vision-Based Pick and Place Robotic System** project aims to develop and deploy an automated robotic solution for object detection, grasping, and placement in manufacturing and logistics environments. The system integrates computer vision (AI-powered object detection), motion planning, and robotic manipulation to achieve **30 picks per minute** with **>99% accuracy**.

### Business Problem
Current manual pick-and-place operations suffer from:
- **High labor costs**: $50,000/year per worker for 2-shift operations
- **Error rates**: 3-5% misplaced items, leading to $25,000/year in rework
- **Throughput limitations**: 15 picks/min per worker (vs 30 picks/min with automation)
- **Scalability challenges**: Labor shortages, training costs
- **Ergonomic risks**: Repetitive strain injuries, workers' compensation claims

### Proposed Solution
Deploy a 6-DOF robotic arm with RGB-D vision, AI-powered detection, and ROS2-based control to automate pick-and-place tasks. The system will:
- Detect objects using deep learning (YOLOv8)
- Estimate 6DoF poses for precise grasping
- Plan collision-free trajectories (MoveIt2)
- Execute picks at 30/minute with 99%+ success rate
- Operate 24/7 with minimal supervision

### Financial Justification
- **Total Investment**: $145,650 (hardware, software, development)
- **Annual Savings**: $87,500 (labor, rework reduction, productivity gains)
- **Payback Period**: 1.7 years
- **5-Year NPV**: $287,475 (at 8% discount rate)
- **IRR**: 58%

### Recommendation
**Approve** the project for immediate initiation with a 6-month development timeline and Q2 2026 deployment target.

## 2. Business Case

### 2.1 Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- **Manual Operation**: 2 workers per shift, 2 shifts/day = 4 FTE
- **Labor Cost**: $50,000/year/FTE × 4 = $200,000/year
- **Throughput**: 15 picks/min × 480 min/shift × 2 shifts = 14,400 picks/day
- **Error Rate**: 5% → 720 errors/day × $1/error (rework) = $720/day = $180,000/year (rework)
- **Downtime**: Worker breaks, shift changes → 10% downtime

**Future State (With Automation):**
- **Robotic Operation**: 0 dedicated workers (1 supervisor for 10 robots)
- **Labor Cost**: $5,000/year/robot (supervision, maintenance)
- **Throughput**: 30 picks/min × 1400 min/day (24/7 operation) = 42,000 picks/day (+192%)
- **Error Rate**: <1% → 420 errors/day (conservative) = $105,000/year
- **Uptime**: 99.5% (vs 90% human)

**Key Metrics:**
- **Payback Period**: 1.85 years (between Year 1 and Year 2)
- **NPV (5 years, 8% discount)**: $287,475
- **IRR**: 58%
- **ROI**: (NPV / Initial Investment) × 100% = 197%

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

| **Scenario** | **Annual Benefit** | **NPV** | **Payback** | **IRR** |
|--------------|--------------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Best Case** (+50%) | $131,250 | $455,000 | 1.2 years | 88% |
| **Base Case** | $87,500 | $287,475 | 1.85 years | 58% |
| **Worst Case** (-30%) | $61,250 | $185,000 | 2.7 years | 39% |

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Minimum annual benefit to break even (NPV=0): $36,500/year
- Margin of safety: $87,500 - $36,500 = **$51,000/year** (140% cushion)

### 2.3 Risk Assessment

| **Risk** | **Probability** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** | **Owner** |
|----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Technical:** Grasp success <99% | Medium | High | Extensive testing, adaptive algorithms, fallback strategies | Tech Lead |
| **Schedule:** Development overrun (>6 months) | Medium | Medium | Agile sprints, weekly reviews, buffer in schedule | PM |
| **Cost:** Budget overrun (>10%) | Low | Medium | Fixed-price contracts, contingency budget (10%) | CFO |
| **Adoption:** User resistance to automation | Low | Medium | Training, change management, involve operators early | HR |
| **Safety:** Incident during operation | Low | High | Comprehensive safety audit, ISO compliance, E-stop | Safety Officer |
| **Supplier:** Robot delivery delay | Medium | Medium | Secure commitments, alternative suppliers | Procurement |
| **Integration:** Incompatibility with existing systems | Low | Low | Early integration testing, standard interfaces | Integrator |

**Risk Score:** Medium (requires active management but acceptable)

### 2.4 Alternatives Considered

| **Alternative** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Decision** |
|-----------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **1. Do Nothing (Manual)** | No upfront cost | High labor cost, low throughput, errors | Rejected: NPV negative |
| **2. Hire More Workers** | Simple, familiar | $200k/year, doesn't scale, turnover | Rejected: Higher OPEX, same error rate |
| **3. Semi-Automation (Conveyor Only)** | Lower cost ($30k) | Still requires 2 workers, limited flexibility | Rejected: Only 20% cost reduction |
| **4. Full Automation (Proposed)** | High ROI, scalable, 24/7 | High CAPEX, technical risk | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **5. Outsource to 3PL** | No CAPEX | $150k/year contract, less control | Rejected: Strategic capability loss |

**Conclusion:** Full automation (Alternative 4) offers best NPV and strategic value.
